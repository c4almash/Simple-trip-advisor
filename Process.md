- Test Driven Development

How did you communicated with one another?
* On the first day of class and we made a Facebook instant messaging group. Instant messaging allowed us to finalize the rest of our communication tools, we agreed on using github issue ticket managment and skype for future meetings.


- The getters and setters along with constructor were first implemented
to get some of the initial tests passing.

- We've then started to write additional failing test cases in accordance
with TDD principles.

- The failing test cases are grouped into issues on GitHub and team
members were to assign themselves to issues that they are willing to fix.
