# Team 1 TDD Processes

- On the first day, we have exchanged our contact information in class
so that we can contact each other quickly.

- The getters and setters along with constructor were first implemented
to get some of the initial tests passing.

- We've then started to write additional failing test cases in accordance
with TDD principles.

- The failing test cases are grouped into issues on GitHub and team
members were to assign themselves to issues that they are willing to fix.
