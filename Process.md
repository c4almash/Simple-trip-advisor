Test Driven Development
=======================

How did you communicated with one another?
------------------------------------------
 On the first day of class and we made a Facebook instant messaging group. Instant messaging allowed us to finalize the rest of our communication tools, we agreed on using github issue ticket managment and skype for future meetings.

Did you have a schedule?
------------------------
Our schedule was...

How did you assign different tasks between group members?
---------------------------------------------------------
We had two physical meeting after class and one on Thurs 25th in Bahen Center

How did you use GitHub issue management system?
-----------------------------------------------
he failing test cases are grouped into issues on GitHub and team
members were to assign themselves to issues that they are willing to fix. Issues that are harder to resolve, 2 team members group together and tackle it whilst updating the entire grouo through IM

Mini Case Study - "We decided to do X, because we thought Y, and, after trying it for a week, we think Z"
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The issue of using double or long [data type] for price of ticket.

Anything else that might give your TA/Instructor an insight to your development proces
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The getters and setters along with constructor were first implemented
to get some of the initial tests passing. We've then started to write additional failing test cases in accordance
with TDD principles.

Important Decision
------------------
We agreed to do day-to-day code in our personal repo then do a pull request with the master towards the end of the excersise.

- If you have too many things to write, focus on the highlights (e.g. The best, worst, and most interesting decisions you've made).
- Review your text for typos.
- Focus on content, not power words.
