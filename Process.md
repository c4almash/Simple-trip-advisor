Test Driven Development
=======================

How did you communicated with one another?
------------------------------------------
 On the first day of class and we made a Facebook instant messaging group. Instant messaging allowed us to finalize the rest of our communication tools, we agreed on using github issue ticket managment and skype for future meetings.

Did you have a schedule?
------------------------

How did you assign different tasks between group members?
---------------------------------------------------------

How did you use GitHub issue management system?
-----------------------------------------------

Mini Case Study - "We decided to do X, because we thought Y, and, after trying it for a week, we think Z"

- The getters and setters along with constructor were first implemented
to get some of the initial tests passing.

- We've then started to write additional failing test cases in accordance
with TDD principles.

- The failing test cases are grouped into issues on GitHub and team
members were to assign themselves to issues that they are willing to fix.
